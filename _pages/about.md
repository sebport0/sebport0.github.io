Hi! My name is Samuel Esteban Bassi. I'm just a curious guy from Argentina that got lost on The Land of Software. This blog tries to:

1. Scream "Thank you so much! You are the best people in the world" to all the people that helped,
   helps and will help me in this adventure across The Land of Software.
2. Share knowledge bits, openly and for free. Directly related to 1.
3. Improve my writing skills(english edition).

Things that interest me:
 - Serverless stuff
 - Python
 - Go
 - AWS
 - Software Architecture
 - Monitoring
 - Mathematics
 - Running.

All comments and corrections are welcome.

Have a nice day!
